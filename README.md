# PHP Repositories for Alpine

By [CODECASTS](https://codecasts.com.br) - **Based on the work of [Valery Kartel](https://github.com/vakartel)**

---
The main goal of this repository (both code and packages) is to provide the latest versions of PHP as they are released on http://php.net.

Additionally, we will include many packaged extensions from PECL.

---

## Release Cycle
Currently, we will support 2 stable minor versions of Alpine and PHP.
Testing Alpine releases (`edge`) will be available for testing but should not be used in production.

Everytime Alpine gets a new stable release, we will support the current minor stable version of PHP and it's previous release.

If a new PHP version becomes available before a new release of Alpine, it will be supported on the current stable, but on on the old stable.

Some examples:

Current stable alpine version is `v3.7`, and the stable release of PHP is 7.2. Alpine v3.7 gets support for PHP `v7.2` and `v7.1`

## Available PHP Versions

Alpine Versions are supported as they're being released. 

You should always use the lastest **STABLE** Alpine version, Right now, that means `Alpine Version 3.6`.

The `v3.6` repositories are intended for alpine `v3.6` version [STABLE RECOMMENTED VERSION].

The `v3.5` repositories are intended for alpine `v3.5` version [LEGACY].

The `edge` repositories are intended for alpine `edge` version [TESTING / NEXT RELEASE].


Right now, the following PHP Versions are available:

### Alpine 3.6 (STABLE)

Only PHP 7.1 will be available for Alpine 3.6. That's because PHP 7.0 is too old now.

| PHP Version | Current PHP Minor Version | Repository URL                            |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 7.1         | 7.1.11                    | http://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.6/php-7.1   |

### Alpine 3.5 (OLD STABLE) (LEGACY)

PHP 7.0 and 7.1 are available for Alpine 3.5. Only because that is how this repository started.

| PHP Version | Current PHP Minor Version | Repository URL                            |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 7.1         | 7.1.7                     | http://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.5/php-7.1   |
| 7.0         | 7.0.21                    | http://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.5/php-7.0   |

### Alpine Edge (3.7 - November Release)

This is the development version of alpine, that will be released on November.
PHP 7.2 will also be released a few days after Alpine 3.7 gets stable, so PHP 7.2 will be available only on Alpine 3.7

| PHP Version | Current PHP Minor Version | Repository URL                            |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 7.1         | 7.1.7                     | http://php.codecasts.rocks/edge/php-7.1   |

### Usage on Docker

If you're looking into this, you probably want to create some Rockstar Docker images, right?

Here is a very basic example for installing PHP 7.1:

```dockerfile

FROM alpine:3.6

ADD https://php.codecasts.rocks/php-alpine.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/php-alpine.rsa.pub
RUN echo "http://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.6/php-7.1" >> /etc/apk/repositories && \
    apk add --update php7 php7-mbstring php7-any-other-extensions-you-may-want

```
