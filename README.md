# PHP Repositories for Alpine - by CODECASTS

**"Up-to-date, PHP packages for Alpine Linux."**

---

Maintained by **[@hernandev](https://github.com/hernandev)**. Based on **[Valery Kartel](https://github.com/vakartel)** scripts.

---

This project provides a simple alternative for running updated PHP on Alpine Linux.

We pack and release PHP versions as soon they are available on http://php.net. (At least, we try to.)

Additionally, many PECL extensions are also available as packages as well.

---

## Release Cycle

For short, this project will support **2 minor version of both PHP and Alpine**  at time.

## Available Repositores

| Alpine Version  | PHP Version             | Status                               | Repository URL

| **`3.7`**       | **`7.2`** / `7.2.3`     | supported until Alpine v3.9 release  | [https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.7/php-7.2](https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.7/php-7.2)
| **`3.7`**       | **`7.1`** / `7.1.12`    | supported until Alpine v3.9 release  | [https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.7/php-7.1](https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.7/php-7.1) 
| **`3.6`**       | **`7.2`** / `7.2.3`     | supported until Alpine v3.8 release  | [https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.6/php-7.2](https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.6/php-7.2)

> PHP 7.0.x is now deprecated and removed from this documentation. Your scripts will not stop working since the files are still available but they will not be receiving new builds from now on.

---

> Each version is available on a separate repository, choose the one you want and follow the instructions below:

## Snippets

The following code snippets are intended for quick usage on either shell scripts or Dockerfile

> Notice that `main` and `community` official repositories must be enabled.

### Dockerfile

You may skil the ca-certificates part if you replace HTTPS by HTTP but you should not. PHP packages will eventually install ca-certificates anyway.

```dockerfile
# change to Alpine 3.6 you like.
FROM alpine:3.7

# trust this project public key to trust the packages.
ADD https://php.codecasts.rocks/php-alpine.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/php-alpine.rsa.pub

## you may join the multiple run lines here to make it a single layer

# make sure you can use HTTPS
RUN apk --update add ca-certificates

# add the repository, make sure you replace the correct versions if you want.
RUN echo "@php https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.7/php-7.2" >> /etc/apk/repositories

# install php and some extensions
# notice the @php is required to avoid getting default php packages from alpine instead.
RUN apk add --update php7@php
RUN apk add --update php7-mbstring@php
RUN apk add --update php7-you-extension-name-here@php
```

### Bash / Shell scripting

> You may skil the ca-certificates part if you replace HTTPS by HTTP but you should not. PHP packages will eventually install ca-certificates anyway.


```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# install curl and certificates to download the key
apk add --update curl ca-certificates

# download the repository public key
curl https://php.codecasts.rocks/php-alpine.rsa.pub -o /etc/apk/keys/php-alpine.rsa.pub

# add the repository for the php / alpine version corresponding
echo "@php https://php.codecasts.rocks/v3.7/php-7.2" >> /etc/apk/repositories

# install packages
# notice that @php is required so you don't end up with default outdated php packages from community repository.
apk add --update php7@php
apk add --update php7-redis@php
apk add --update php7-any-other-extension@php

```


## Available Packages

The following packages are available for installation on both 7.2 and 7.1 repositories:

- **Core Packages (Provide Binaries or Modules)**

`php7` `php7-common` `php7-fpm` `php7-cgi` `php7-apache2`

- **Special Packages (Not needed at runtime)**

`php7-doc` `php7-dev`

- **PHP 7.2 only extensions**

`php7-sodium`

> `libsodium` extension is now part of PHP 7.2, it got renamed to `sodium` only and it reflects the version 2 of the extension.
> The original extension, at version 1 was kept built for PHP 7.2 for legacy purposes, be sure to not install the two extensions together and hope it will work (it actually may but I don't adivise you to try).
